      		<!--<p>PAGE1-PACKAGE COURSE AGREEMENT - General Information Page</p>
			This is a legally binding instrument between ADHI Schools, LLC sometimes referred to in this document as the firm or the school or we and the above named party, hereafter referred to as the student or you. This is intended to have a binding effect, please read slowly and carefully. This document will confirm that you are enrolling in the above mentioned class offered by ADHI Schools, LLC. You understand that your enrollment in this course does not provide you with any classroom instruction. To complete this course, you will be required to spend a minimum of 45 hours and eighteen (18) calendar days per course with the material and complete a 100 question, multiple choice, open-book final examination. The Bureau of Real Estate has approved this course as a correspondence course.
			<br/><br/>
			<p>Optional live lecture supplementation</p>
			If you are signing up for a class that has live lecture supplementation time, you are welcome to come to any of those optional review sessions. These sessions are designed so that you can ask any questions to our instructors and review key course material. These lectures are optional and are not a requirement to obtaining your course certificate.
			<br/><br/>
			<p>Information regarding the 100 question final exam</p>
			During our 100 question multiple choice examination, you may refer to the instructional material supplied to you through the course. A passing score on this exam is 60 percent or better. You will be given 2 hours and 30 minutes to complete this examination. Final examinations are either administered at one of our school locations during class time or by designated proctor. If the student decides to take the examination in the firms environment, the student should know that they are administered every class session by an employee of the school in an area separate from the classroom. Currently, Bureau of Real Estate guidelines dictate that you must wait a minimum of eighteen (18) days from the date of receipt of materials before taking the final exam. Upon passing the final exam you will receive a certificate of completion issued by the school. If you pass this examination the transcript of completion will be mailed to the student within 72 hours of grading. Reading the provided text will obviously prove useful in completing this examination, so make use of the textbook that is provided to you!
			<br/> <br/>
			If you decide to take the 100 question examination through our online system you are also welcome to do so. If you are going to take it online you will not be able to cut, copy, or print during the examination. The system will score your examination for you and store your certificate in your profile assuming you have passed.
			<br/> <br/>
			In the event the student fails the final exam, the student may retake the test until they pass for no additional cost. However, in the event of a failed examination the student must wait another eighteen (18) days from the date they last took the examination before they are allowed to retest. The objective here is to learn and retain as much about the subject matter as possible.
			<br/><br/>
			<p>No legal advice given</p>
			Throughout this course you will learn about various aspects of real estate. It is the intention of the course and the firm to provide each student with up-to-date, timely and accurate information. However, the firm is not a legal one and our instructors are not attorneys. As such, none of the information disseminated should be relied upon as legal advice of any kind. Please consult your tax and legal advisors if you desire tax or legal advice. Also note that the Bureau of Real Estate has a website <a href="http://www.calbre.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.calbre.ca.gov</a> and on this site there is a form you may download to evaluate the course as a whole.
			 <br/><br/>
			<p>Cost of the course and what it includes</p>
			The cost of the course is as outlined and shipping charges are calculated per FedEx. Your enrollment is valid for a two year time period. Your fee includes the text book, the administration of the final exam, the grading of that final exam, fifteen (15) ungraded chapter quizzes, and the issuance of your course certificate, provided the course is completed within our two (2) year time frame. You are advised that the possession of a certificate of completion from this class alone does not allow you to act as a real estate salesperson.
			<br/><br/>
			<p>Refund and cancellation policy</p>
			The student shall be entitled seven (7) calendar days from the date of enrollment to request a refund. If a refund is requested, the school will refund all monies received with the exception of a $25.00 processing fee. The textbook must also be returned to the school in unused condition. Return shipping is the responsibility of the student. If the school determines that unusual wear and tear has occurred with the textbook, or the text has been written in, the school will (in addition to the $25.00 processing fee) retain $39.95 for the textbook. All refunds will be mailed to the student within ten (10) days of receiving the request. No refunds will be issued after the seven (7) calendar days have lapsed. In lieu of a refund, the student may transfer the enrollment to another party within thirty (30) days of the date of enrollment. In the event of transfer, the transferee must sign a new enrollment agreement and you must sign a form indicating that you wish to transfer this enrollment. Once thirty (30) days have passed, no refunds or transfers will be allowed. All refunds will be made by business check to the student named above, regardless of who wrote the check or method of payment.

			<br/><br/>
			Private providers of pre-license statutory real estate courses must obtain course approval from the Bureau of Real Estate (CalBRE). As part of the approval process, the CalBRE reviews the course materials only. The CalBRE does not qualify the school or course provider. In addition, there is no regulatory oversight of private pre-license course providers who offer courses or programs costing $500 or less. For courses or programs over $500, qualification by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education is required, in addition to CalBRE course approval. As a result, if a course provider offering a course costing $500 or less fails to deliver the educational course/program as represented, a studentâ€™s monetary remedy is to seek redress in Small Claims Court. Students are cautioned to fully understand the education course/program offered by the provider before enrolling or registering. A list of pre-license statutory courses approved by the CalBRE can be found on the CalBRE Web site at <a href="http://www.calbre.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.calbre.ca.gov</a> under CalBRE Records.
