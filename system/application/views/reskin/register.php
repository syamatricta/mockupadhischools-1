Students will also need to provide their drivers license number in order to register for the course and this number will again need to be input in order to access the final exam.  Once the 2 hours and 30 minutes have lapsed, the final exam will automatically time out and score the exam for the questions answered.  Any unanswered questions will automatically be scored as incorrect.  Final exam access is limited to 'one time only'.  If a second final exam is offered it will have completely different questions.  If the student fails the second final exam they must reregister for the course and complete it again.

                In the event the student fails the final exam, the student may retake the test until they pass for no additional cost. However, in the event of a failed examination the student must wait another eighteen (18) days from the date they last took the examination before they are allowed to retest. The objective here is to learn and retain as much about the subject matter as possible.

                Throughout this course you will learn about various aspects of real estate. It is the intention of the course and the firm to provide each student with up-to-date, timely and accurate information. However, the firm is not a legal one and our instructors are not attorneys. As such, none of the information disseminated should be relied upon as legal advice of any kind. Please consult your tax and legal advisors if you desire tax or legal advice. Also note that the Bureau of Real Estate has a website <a href="http://www.calbre.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.calbre.ca.gov</a> and on this site there is a form you may download to evaluate the course as a whole.

                Private providers of pre-license statutory real estate courses must obtain course approval from the Bureau of Real Estate (CalBRE). As part of the approval process, the CalBRE reviews the course materials only. The CalBRE does not qualify the school or course provider. In addition, there is no regulatory oversight of private pre-license course providers who offer courses or programs costing $500 or less. For courses or programs over $500, qualification by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education is required, in addition to CalBRE course approval. As a result, if a course provider offering a course costing $500 or less fails to deliver the educational course/program as represented, a studentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s monetary remedy is to seek redress in Small Claims Court. Students are cautioned to fully understand the education course/program offered by the provider before enrolling or registering. A list of pre-license statutory courses approved by the CalBRE can be found on the CalBRE Web site at <a href="http://www.calbre.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.calbre.ca.gov</a> under CalBRE Records.
