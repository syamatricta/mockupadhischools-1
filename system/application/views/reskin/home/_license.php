                    The Price of our real estate class includes all of your course materials: three books containing over 1,500 pages of 
                    perfectly engineered real estate goodness. The Real Estate Principles book covers the basics of real estate 
                    in California from contracts to appraisal and financing. The next required book, Real Estate 
                    Practice, covers the actual practice of real estate. You will learn how to get listings, how to work 
                    with buyers and more contract stuff. The final book is an elective of your choice.
                    We recommend Legal Aspects of Real Estate as we feel that is the most useful in preparing for the state examination. You have your choice though of several  others on our registration page.
