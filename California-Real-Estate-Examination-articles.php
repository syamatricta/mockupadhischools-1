						You can take the California real estate examination as soon as you have completed the college classes that are necessary to qualify for the exam. You must be at least 18 years old before you take the exam. You also must be a citizen of the United States. You do not need to be a resident of California, however. A resident of any state may take the exam and become a licensed real estate agent in the state of California.The <a href="http://www.adhischools.com" class="art_page_dec">California real estate examination</a> can not be taken unless you have passed all of the necessary classes. Many schools offer these classes, but it is usually better to take them from a school that has knowledge and experience in real estate education. Some of these schools offer classes on the campus and other schools allow you to take the classes online in your own time.The <a href="http://www.adhischools.com" class="art_page_dec">California real estate examination</a> is given by the Bureau of Real Estate. This is the licensing body for all real estate agents. <br />
						<br />
						They offer an exam for real estate agents and a separate exam for those who wish to become a real estate broker. You must first become a licensed real estate agent and work for at least two years under a licensed broker before you take the brokers exam for yourself.The <a href="http://www.adhischools.com" class="art_page_dec">California real estate examination</a> for brokers requires another set of classes. You can usually take these classes at the same school that you take your classes to become a licensed real estate agent. There are additional requirements such as you have to submit finger prints and you will need to be able to pass a back ground check. Certain criminal convictions can cause you not to qualify to become a real estate agent.The <a href="http://www.adhischools.com" class="art_page_dec">California real estate examination</a> can be applied for as soon as you complete your required college classes, so long as you meet all of the other requirements. Once you pass the exam you must apply to the Bureau of Real Estate to get your license. <br />
						<br />
						You can make quite a bit of money as a real estate agent or real estate broker considering the amount of education required.
						The <a href="http://www.adhischools.com" class="art_page_dec">California real estate examination</a> is not easy to pass, but if you study hard and prepare for it you will have the best chance of success. People who do not pass the test are usually the ones that did not prepare well for it. Choosing a good school to take your classes will help you know what to study and how you can study for it with the greatest chance of success.The <a href="http://www.adhischools.com" class="art_page_dec">California real estate examination</a> for brokers is not the same test given to those first applying for their real estate license. If you get your license to sell real estate you will need to work under the umbrella of a licensed broker.The <a href="http://www.adhischools.com" class="art_page_dec">California real estate examination</a> can be taken as soon as you find a good school and get your classes under your belt.
