                    There is a certain bad dream that haunts most people well into adulthood. You are in a classroom or a school and you find out there is a test being handed out that you didn't know about and for which you haven't studied.  This sort of anxiety dream is natural, and comes from that nagging fear of being unprepared for what life has in store for you.  When you decide to take a <a href="http://www.adhischools.com" class="art_page_dec">Real Estate license</a> exam in California that dream shouldn't become a reality.
